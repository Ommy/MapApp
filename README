What does this application do?  :

This application is being made in order to assist those new to the University of Waterloo, those visiting, 
or those who get lost on occasion because they don't know their way around all the buildings at Waterloo.
The user will be able to select an initial point which is where they are, and a final point where they want to go
and the application will give them the shortest path possible and give every direction to take.



Currently we have the following finished:

  *Browsing all the buildings at UW, and being able to search for them using keywords.
  *Digital map with complete nodes at entrances of buildings and every point at which paths fork
  *Make a database of the nodes and the lengths between each node

Next steps:
  *Determine user input
  *Finalize UI
